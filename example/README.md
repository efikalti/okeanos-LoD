# Description
In this directory you can find some example application that can run on a
Lambda Instance. There is an extensive README.md file inside batch_word_count
and stream_word_count directories.

Moreover, inside kafka_consumer and kafka_producer directories you can find two
applications that can read and send data from and to an Apache Kafka broker
respectively. Inside each of these  directories there is a README.md file that
describes each application.

These examples are meant to be used as guides for writing your own applications
and programs that will send and receive data to and from Apache Kafka.

Please refer to the README.md file in each directory for more information.
