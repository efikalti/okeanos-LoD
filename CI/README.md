# Description
Scripts to fully deploy ~okeanos Lambda on Demand service.

Inside this directory there are two groups of scripts, each one of which will
fully deploy the ~okeanos Lambda on Demand service. The only difference between
these two scripts is that, the one under `devel/` directory will use the `devel`
branch of ~okeanos Lambda on Demand Github repository, while the one under
`master/` directory will use the `master` branch.


# Usage
For more information regarding the usage of these scripts, see the README.md
files inside `devel/` and `master/` directories.
