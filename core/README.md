# Core python library

## Instalation

- Install required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install package using `python setup.py install`


## Testing

To test the library we use `tox`. In order to run the tests:

- Make sure you have tox installed `pip install tox`
- Run `tox`

This will automatically create the testing environments required and run the tests
